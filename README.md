# Customer SegmentationAnalysis for Subcription Service

 ## Introduction

Purpose: The purpose of this analysis is to segment customers of the subscription service to better understand their behaviors, preferences, and potential lifetime value. This segmentation will help inform personalized marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and optimize product offerings.

Business Context: The subscription service offers three tiers: Basic, Premium, and Standard. By understanding customer patterns and segmenting them based on subscription type, region, and behavior (e.g., churn likelihood, duration of subscription), we aim to enhance decision-making and revenue growth.


 ## Data Overview

Dataset Description: The dataset used for this analysis includes customer demographics, subscription details, revenue, and cancellation status. Key columns include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

SubscriptionType: Indicates whether a customer is subscribed to Basic, Premium, or Standard.

SubscriptionStart and SubscriptionEnd: Start and end dates of subscriptions.

Revenue: Revenue generated by each customer.

Region: Geographical region of the customer.

Canceled: Indicates whether a customer has canceled their subscription (True/False).

##  Methodology

Segmentation Criteria: The customers were segmented based on several criteria:

1. Demographics: Segmentation by Region to identify geographical trends.


2. Subscription Type: Grouping by SubscriptionType (Basic, Premium, Standard).


3. Behavioral: Segmentation by subscription duration and revenue to understand customer engagement and value.
